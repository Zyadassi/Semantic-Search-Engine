# Web Development Best Practices

## Performance Optimization
Web performance is critical for user experience. Here are some key practices:

1. **Minimize HTTP Requests**: Combine files, use CSS sprites, and lazy load images.
2. **Compress Assets**: Gzip your CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files.
3. **Cache Resources**: Use browser caching and CDNs for static assets.
4. **Optimize Images**: Use modern formats like WebP and serve responsive images.

## Security
Security should be a top priority in web development:

- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies updated

## Testing
Comprehensive testing ensures code quality:

- Write unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for user workflows
- Use code coverage tools to identify gaps
